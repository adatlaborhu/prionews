#prionews

A very old project of mine. It collects and analyzes the news from ABC, BBC and CNN. It pulls and connects the articles from different news-portals if they are about the same topic. Finally it compares them by credibility based on the wordings of the articles. Written in bash and some SQL.

UPDATE1: To make this work you need to run igazhir.sh. It calls everything else automatically. Ideally you run it with crontab every hour.

UPDATE2: I shut this project down in 2013. Since then the scripts, that are getting the data from the news portals may be out-of-date. Sorry.
