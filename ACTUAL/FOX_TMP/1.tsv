burlington, vt. &#8211; a vermont woman held against her will for more than
five weeks at a psychiatric ward after her estranged husband killed their son
and then hanged himself was ordered released by a judge friday.
christina schumacher, 48, was ordered released immediately from fletcher allen
health care in burlington by vermont superior court judge kevin griffin, the
burlington_free_press reported.
schumacher had been at the hospital since dec. 19, a day after 14-year-old
gunnar schumacher and 49-year-old ludwig schumacher were found dead in an essex
apartment. police said the father strangled the high school freshman before he
hanged himself.
it was unclear whether schumacher had left the facility by friday night.
griffin said in his ruling that he disagreed with a doctor's assessment before
schumacher arrived for a regular appointment the day after the murder-suicide
that she needed to admit herself or be taken into custody.
"the court did not find, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent was
a person in need of treatment at the time of admission or application, nor a
patient in need of further treatment at the time of the hearing," griffin wrote
in his ruling.
the burlington free press reported that, according to court records, schumacher
indicated to her sister after the couple separated last summer that she would
kill herself if anything happened to her two children.
"i am not ill; i am simply a mother who is grieving the tragic loss of her
young son," schumacher told the burlington free press this week. "no mother
should ever have to experience this loss."
schumacher told the newspaper that she and her insurance company had been
billed for the unwanted treatment.
mike noble, a spokesman for the hospital, said that he can't speak to the
specifics of the case but "that in all matters such as this we make decisions
that we think are in the best interests of the patient."
schumacher had warned police that she feared for her son's safety hours before
the bodies were found, according to court papers. she told essex police the
night before the murder-suicide that she feared ludwig schumacher might try to
take the teenager out of the country, according to court papers.
ludwig schumacher was a former member of the vermont national guard and state
republican campaign official. police said he left a typed suicide note in the
apartment.
