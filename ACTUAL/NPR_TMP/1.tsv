anti-government protesters in ukraine seized city hall in the capital, kiev, as
the country's interior minister said two months of efforts to resolve the
unrest had been "futile."
police warned that they might storm the administration building to free two
officers they say were captured by demonstrators. russia today says three
officers were seized and that one of them had been released and hospitalized
with a stab wound.
npr's corey flintoff, reporting from kiev, says that overnight protesters re-
lit fires at barricades near government buildings in the capital, sending up
columns of black smoke.
"they've been throwing rocks and firebombs at riot police, who have been
responding with tear gas and stun grenades," corey says.
the bbc reports:
     "[interior] minister vitaliy zakharchenko said negotiations with the
     protesters had failed. he blamed 'radical groups' for the unrest,
     adding protesters had arms."
     "the comments came as activists tried to seize the energy ministry."
     "four protesters and a policeman are reported to have died in
     protests that began last year after the government's rejection of a
     treaty with the eu."
zakharchenko said that other countries "must not close their eyes" to rising
extremism in ukraine.
as the two-way's mark memmott reported earlier, the unrest comes despite a
"fragile truce" that's supposed to be in place between the government and
demonstrators.
the protesters are angry at the government's decision to forego closer ties
with the eu in favor of closer relations with moscow, which ruled ukraine with
an iron fist until 1991, when kiev won independence as the soviet union
collapsed.
corey reports that president viktor yanukovych had promised to release some
activists from jail and to revise a new law that bans most forms of protest,
but the opposition accuses him of stalling for time and ignoring their demands
for his resignation.
demonstrators have taken over government buildings in more than a dozen cities
in western ukraine.
the associated press reports that protesters seized the headquarters of the
energy ministry, but abandoned it hours later.
according to the ap:
     "in vinnitsya, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of kiev,
     hundreds of demonstrators stormed the local administration building,
     ukrainian news agencies said. until the past week, the protests had
     been centered in kiev with only smaller demonstrations elsewhere, but
     since the kiev clashes began on sunday, a score of local government
     buildings have been seized in the country's west, where support for
     president yanukovych is thin."
