the prolonged execution of an inmate in ohio during which he repeatedly gasped
and snorted amounted to cruel and unusual punishment which should not be
allowed to happen again, the inmate's family said in a federal lawsuit.
the lawsuit, filed late on friday, also alleges the drug maker that produced
the medications used in the lethal injection illegally allowed them to be used
for an execution and should be prohibited from making them available for
capital punishment.
dennis mcguire "repeated cycles of snorting, gurgling and arching his back,
appearing to writhe in pain," the lawsuit said. "it looked and sounded as
though he was suffocating."
mcguire's_execution_lasted_26_minutes, the longest since the state resumed
putting inmates to death in 1999, according to an associated press analysis of
all 53 execution logs maintained by the department of rehabilitation and
correction.
it remains unclear what mcguire experienced. the ap observed him appearing to
fall unconscious and remaining so while he snorted, gasped and opened and shut
his mouth repeatedly.
mcguire's_execution,_during_which_his_adult_children_sobbed_in_dismay, has led
to several calls for a moratorium on capital punishment in the state.
in addition, a separate federal lawsuit filed on thursday seeks to stop the
march execution of a killer in ohio on the grounds that condemned inmates could
be clinically alive for as long as 45 minutes after a time of death is
announced in the state death chamber.
attorneys for gregory lott, who is scheduled to die 19 march for setting an
east cleveland man on fire in 1986 and leaving him to die, also say ohio is
breaking state and federal law by using the drugs without a prescription.
the lawsuit by mcguire's family targets lake forest, illinois-based hospira
inc, the manufacturer of the drugs used in mcguire's execution.
the company knew its drugs were being used for executions but continued to sell
them to ohio, according to the lawsuit, which seeks damages above $75,000.
hospira should have known that the drugs "would cause unnecessary and extreme
pain and suffering during the execution process," the lawsuit said.
in 2011, hospira ended production of sodium thiopental, a drug used by many
states for executions, including ohio, after it could not guarantee to italian
authorities where its factory was located that the drug would not be used for
capital punishment.
the company has also prohibited other drugs from being used in executions, and
will take the same steps for midazolam and hydromorphone, the drugs used in the
mcguire execution, according to a company statement.
medical experts would not comment on mcguire's execution or speculate about
what he experienced. they agreed that used for surgeries, the two drugs by
themselves would not cause pain.
